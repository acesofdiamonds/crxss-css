This theme is meant to be used by anyone who wants to use it.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.

CRXSS Simple. 
This theme was deeply inspired by my nostalgia for the forums of the 2000-2010's. It has a modern twist made
specifically for imageboards, and designed for the current age of the internet going forward into 2020. 

It's meant to be inoffensive, minimalist, and easy on the eyes. Dark themes should be default on most websites, but 
this one is a medium dark palette so it's not too jarring and remains soft.
The colors for dark and light crxss simple were inspired by black and white old school newspapers. 
This is monochromatic, with optional variations for splashes of colors (see: CRXSS Skittles themes).

Author notes: Please keep in mind that I designed this CSS to be easy to read and modify. It's not perfect; I got
as close as possible. I am hoping that the Table of Contents and notes are sufficient  for anyone who doesn't have knowledge of 
css, but would like to customize their website. I don't believe in gatekeeping, and wish to see most websites 
using nice designs.
I really wish I was slightly more skilled with CSS and code so that I could design something truly professional, but
we're not in heaven so perfection doesn't exist. This is as close as I could get with my current knowledge.
The only thing I could not perfect was the footer at the bottom of the website. The position was difficult, if not impossible, 
for me to get right.

Mobile Note: This was designed with mobile in mind. The mobile attributes are easy to find. They're all contained
underneath the desktop css. Mostly, the mobile attributes change the sizes and positions to make it easier to use on 
small screens. 

Report Note: crxss.org uses Wordpress in addition to LainChan. The report feature is a form widget from Wordpress.
It uses a div for an image href on top of the threads.html section in our modified version.
The #report element can be ignored or removed as you desire, as this is a band-aid for the report error within
the LainChan software. It is not a perfect fix, but at least it works. Ignoring the #report element might be sufficient,
but you will need to remove the visibility element if you want the report feature to be seen. In this CSS, it is 
hidden by default because of the band aid fix we have on crxss.
